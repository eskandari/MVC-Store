This is a sample project with mvc. Also, I have used entity framework.
There is no layerng. Simple project.

Here is our stories:

    CRUD for Categories
    CRUD for Products
    CRUD for Customers with their Address
    Place an Order
    A view for customers with search, sorting, paging and details which shows us orders of a customer
